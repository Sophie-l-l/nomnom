This is our team's first prototype for the NomNom AI Therapy App.

Before running, make sure you create an .env file for backend folder and an .env file for the client folder. Use the env_example file in each folder as an template to build.

We are also developing another prototype for the AI Voice Agent (talking with the bot directly besides typing). The link to that prototype is [here](https://github.com/PhucNguyen-rsc/voice-agent). In the future, we are planning to merge these two prototypes together into one app.
